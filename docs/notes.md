#### Eslint 
- Eslint and its various packages can be installed globally, as can eslint-watch. 
- running eslint --init will then create a local config file 
- to run eslint-watch, use the command esw file.js --watch - it will also run eslint normally without the watch flag 
- eslint-watch seems to require a local install of eslint
